# typer-easy
I'm an easy Typer library. I pretend to write on the screen. However, it is only fake. I'm programmed to do so.


## Code Example

This is where I place, letter by letter, the words. There is no limit to the amount of words.
typers = {};
elements = document.getElementsByClassName("typer");
for (var i = 0, e; e = elements[i++];) {
  typers[e.id] = new Typer(e);
}
